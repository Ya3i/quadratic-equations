# quadratic-equations
a Program with phyton for Solving quadratic equations

This program takes input for coefficients a, b, and c and calculates discriminant d=b^2-4ac.
If d > 0 , it calculates the two real roots, if d == 0, it calculates the only real root,
and if d < 0, it calculates the complex roots. The program uses the math module to perform
square root operation and abs function to get the absolute value of d.
